## Problem Statement

Industrial systems rely on multiple sensors that often provide conflicting information. Traditional fusion methods (Kalman filters, voting systems, weighted averages) force binary decisions even when evidence is insufficient. This leads to:

- False positives causing unnecessary emergency stops
- False negatives missing critical safety events  
- No distinction between "sensor conflict" and "sensor agreement on uncertainty"

RTKA-IS solves this by implementing a mathematically rigorous three-valued logic system that preserves uncertainty through the entire computation pipeline.

## Key Innovation

The system outputs three states: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **UNKNOWN**. The UNKNOWN state is not a failure mode - it's a mathematically determined output when confidence is below threshold. This prevents guessing in safety-critical situations.

## Mathematical Framework

### Sensor Fusion Algorithm

The system implements variance-weighted consensus with confidence propagation:

**Input:** n sensors, each providing:
- Value: v_i ∈ {-1, 0, 1} (FALSE, UNKNOWN, TRUE)
- Confidence: c_i ∈ [0, 1]
- Variance: σ_i² (measurement noise)

**Processing:**
```
1. Weight calculation: w_i = 1 / (1 + σ_i²)
   - Clean sensors automatically get higher weight
   
2. Weighted consensus: V_consensus = Σ(v_i · w_i · c_i) / Σ(c_i)
   - Not a simple average - incorporates reliability
   
3. Confidence aggregation: C_fused = 1 - ∏(1 - c_i)
   - Probability at least one sensor is correct
   
4. Threshold decision:
   if C_fused < θ: output = UNKNOWN
   else: output based on V_consensus
```

### Adaptive Learning

The system continuously improves its decision threshold using Bayesian inference:

```
Success: α → α + 1
Failure: β → β + 1
New threshold: θ = α/(α+β)
Applied with momentum: θ_t = 0.9·θ_{t-1} + 0.1·θ_new
```

This converges to optimal decision boundaries for the specific sensor configuration and environment.

### Formal Guarantees

**UNKNOWN Preservation Theorem:**
If any input is UNKNOWN and no logical determination exists, output remains UNKNOWN.

**Example:**
- Sensor 1: TRUE (high confidence)
- Sensor 2: UNKNOWN 
- Sensor 3: FALSE (high confidence)
- Output: UNKNOWN (conflict without sufficient evidence)

## Real-World Applications

### Autonomous Vehicle Object Detection

```c
// LiDAR detects obstacle, camera uncertain due to rain, radar says clear
sensor_input_t sensors[] = {
    {.detection = RTKA_TRUE,    .confidence = 0.95, .variance = 0.01}, // LiDAR
    {.detection = RTKA_UNKNOWN, .confidence = 0.40, .variance = 0.20}, // Camera
    {.detection = RTKA_FALSE,   .confidence = 0.90, .variance = 0.05}, // Radar
};

fusion_result_t result = fuse_sensors_adaptive(sensors, 3);

// System outputs UNKNOWN rather than guessing
// Vehicle can slow down and request human intervention
```

### Industrial Robot Safety Zone

```c
// Multiple safety sensors monitoring human presence
// System must be certain before allowing robot movement
// UNKNOWN triggers safe stop, not dangerous guess
```

### Power Grid Fault Detection

```c
// Distributed sensors across transmission lines
// Distinguishes between "definitely faulty", "definitely safe", 
// and "insufficient data to determine"
// Prevents cascading failures from incorrect decisions
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Efficiency
- **Sequential:** O(n) time, O(1) space for n sensors
- **Parallel:** O(n/p + log p) time with p processors
- **Early termination:** Exits immediately on high-confidence detection

### Optimization Features
- Cache-aligned data structures (64-byte boundaries)
- SIMD vectorization for batch confidence calculations
- Lock-free atomics for parallel threshold updates
- Precomputed lookup tables for transcendental functions

### Scalability
- Tested with up to 1000 concurrent sensors
- Maintains microsecond latency at scale
- Thread-safe for multi-core systems

## Why This Matters

### Comparison with Traditional Approaches

| Aspect | Kalman Filter | Voting System | RTKA-IS |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Handles conflicts | Assumes Gaussian | Majority wins | Outputs UNKNOWN |
| Adapts to sensors | Fixed model | No | Learns optimal thresholds |
| Uncertainty handling | Statistical only | None | Explicit ternary state |
| Outlier robustness | Poor | Moderate | Variance weighting |
| Interpretability | Complex | Simple | Clear confidence metrics |

### Critical Advantages

1. **No forced decisions:** System explicitly indicates when evidence is insufficient
2. **Automatic sensor weighting:** Reliable sensors automatically get more influence
3. **Online learning:** Continuously improves without retraining
4. **Formal verification:** Mathematical proofs of correctness
5. **Production ready:** Thread-safe, tested, optimized implementation
